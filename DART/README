DART (Dynamic Animation and Robotics Toolkit) is a collaborative, cross-platform, 
open source library created by the Graphics Lab and Humanoid Robotics Lab at
Georgia Institute of Technology with ongoing contributions from the Personal
Robotics Lab at University of Washington and Open Source Robotics Foundation. 
The library provides data structures and algorithms for kinematic and dynamic
applications in robotics and computer animation.
