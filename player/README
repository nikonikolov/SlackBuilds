Player is a robot device interface. It provides a network interface to a 
variety of robot and sensor hardware. Player's client/server model allows 
robot control programs to be written in any programming language and to run 
on any computer with a network connection to the robot. Player supports 
multiple concurrent client connections to devices, creating new possibilities 
for distributed and collaborative sensing and control. 

Player provides a clean and simple interface to the robot's sensors and 
actuators over the IP network. Your client program talks to Player over 
a TCP socket, reading data from sensors, writing commmands to actuators, 
and configuring devices on the fly.
